Parity is a simple error detection mechanism used in digital systems to identify single-bit errors in data transmission or storage. It involves adding an extra bit (called the parity bit) to a binary message to ensure a specific number of 1s (even or odd).

A parity generator is a digital circuit that takes a binary data word as input and produces a parity bit as output. This parity bit is then appended to the original data before transmission or storage.
It ensures that the number of 1s in the data (including the parity bit) follows a chosen parity scheme:

Even parity: Total number of 1s is even.

Odd parity: Total number of 1s is odd.

Working:
The generator counts the number of 1s in the data word.

Based on whether even or odd parity is selected, it generates a parity bit (0 or 1) to meet that condition.

PARITY CHECKER:
 Definition:
A parity checker is a digital circuit that receives a binary data word along with a parity bit and verifies whether the received data obeys the expected parity condition.

🔧 Function:
It detects single-bit errors that might have occurred during data transmission or storage.

⚙️ Working:
The checker computes the parity of the received data (including the parity bit).

If the result does not match the expected parity type (even or odd), an error is detected.
