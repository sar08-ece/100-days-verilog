A parameterized finite state machine (FSM) that detects a 4-bit binary sequence from a serial input stream. Designed in Verilog HDL using non-blocking assignments and supports sequence overlapping.

üõ†Ô∏è Features
‚úÖ Parameterized 4-bit target sequence

‚úÖ Overlapping sequence detection

‚úÖ Moore machine implementation

‚úÖ Synthesizable and simulation-ready

‚úÖ Uses clean FSM structure with state parameters.

 Line 1
  
 
S0: next_state = (in == TARGET_SEQ[3]) ? S1 : S0;
S0 = Idle state. Waiting for the first bit.

If input bit matches the first bit of the target sequence, move to S1.

Otherwise, stay in S0.

Example: For TARGET_SEQ = 4'b1101, if in == 1, go to S1.

Line 2
  
 
S1: next_state = (in == TARGET_SEQ[2]) ? S2 : ((in == TARGET_SEQ[3]) ? S1 : S0);
You matched the first bit and are now in S1.

Now you're checking if the second bit matches.

If it matches ‚Üí go to S2.

If not, check if in is again the first bit of the sequence:

This allows overlapping, e.g., input like 1 1 0 1 1 0 1

If it looks like a new start, go back to S1.

Else, go back to S0.

Example: 1101101 ‚Äî after detecting first 1101, the next 1 should be reinterpreted as start of another match.

Line 3
  
 
S2: next_state = (in == TARGET_SEQ[1]) ? S3 : ((in == TARGET_SEQ[3]) ? S1 : S0);
You matched 2 bits.

Now check if the third bit matches.

If yes ‚Üí go to S3.

If not:

If in == TARGET_SEQ[3] (first bit of pattern), restart as S1 (overlap)

Else ‚Üí reset to S0

Line 4
  
 
S3: next_state = (in == TARGET_SEQ[0]) ? S4 : ((in == TARGET_SEQ[3]) ? S1 : S0);
You've matched 3 bits so far.

If the last bit matches, go to S4 (detection done ‚úÖ)

If not:

Check for possible overlap start again (if in == first bit)

Else reset

 Line 5
  
 
S4: next_state = (in == TARGET_SEQ[2]) ? S2 : ((in ==TARGET_SEQ[3]) ? S1 : S0);
You're in the detection state, having seen a full match.

Now check if current in may start the next match (overlap).

If in == second bit, go to S2

If in == first bit, go to S1

Else reset

 This handles overlapping patterns like 1101101 (where a new match starts during or just after an old match).

If in = 1 0 1 1 0 1 1
The detected output will go high twice, indicating two matches with overlap.
