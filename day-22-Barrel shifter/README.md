A barrel shifter is a digital circuit that can shift or rotate data by a specified number of positions in a single clock cycle. Unlike regular shift registers that shift one bit per cycle, a barrel shifter performs the shift or rotation instantly (combinational logic) or per clock (with sequential logic for continuous operation).

The barrel shifter takes a data word and shifts or rotates its bits based on:

The shift amount (e.g., 0 to 7 for 8-bit)

The operation type (shift or rotate)
