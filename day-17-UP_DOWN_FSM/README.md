FSM-Based Up/Down Counter
This project implements a parameterized binary up/down counter using a Finite State Machine (FSM) with three clean states. The counter can increment, decrement, or hold based on input control signals.

Here are the FSM states:

State        	Description
IDLE	    Wait for up or down input
COUNT_UP	Increment the counter by 1
COUNT_DOWN	Decrement the counter by 1
