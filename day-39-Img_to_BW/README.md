DAY 39:

Converting the given image to black and white:

The given image is first converted to hex file(256 x 256) which has 65536 lines(8 bit).

The logic:
If the hex number is greater than 128, we convert it to it black.
Else we convert it to white.

After each conversion,we store it in a file and process it using MATLAB or python to view the B & W image.
