PWM GENERATION:

This project implements a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal generator in Verilog with a variable duty cycle. 

The module operates using an 8-bit counter that increments on every positive edge of the input clock. Based on a given duty cycle input (ranging from 0 to 255), the output signal pwm_out remains high for that proportion of the cycle and low for the remainder, creating a rectangular waveform with adjustable high-time.
