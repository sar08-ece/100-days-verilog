//8 bit ALU 
//16 operations

We use 4 bit select lines to do the 16 operations

Add-->Add the two 8 bit numbers.

Sub-->Gives the difference between the two numbers.

Inc-->Add 1 to the given binary number.

Dec-->Dec 1 to the given binary number.

AND-->Gives the logical AND.

OR->Gives the logical OR.

EXOR-->Gives the logical EXOR.

NOT-->Gives the logical NOT.


Shift left-->A<<1.
Shift right-->A>>1.
Rotate left -->
Suppose we have a 8 bit number.Shifting left makes the MSB to move to the LSB.

Rotate right-->
Suppose we have a 8 bit number.Shifting left makes the LSB to move to the MSB.

Zero flag->If the result is zero.
Negative->IF the MSB of the result is 1.
