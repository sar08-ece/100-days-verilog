This module implements a Dual-Port Synchronous RAM in Verilog.

 It allows two independent ports (Port A and Port B) to perform simultaneous read and write operations, all synchronized to a common clock signal.

 Configuration
Address Width: 7 bits

Data Width: 32 bits

Memory Depth: 128 locations

Total Memory Size: 128 words Ã— 32 bits = 4096 bits = 512 bytes
