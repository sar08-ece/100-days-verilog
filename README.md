# 100-days-verilog
Welcome to my 100 Days of Verilog Challenge! ðŸš€
This repository is dedicated to practicing and mastering Verilog HDL through daily projects and exercises, ranging from beginner-friendly basics to more advanced digital design modules.
Over the course of 100 days, Iâ€™ll be building and simulating Verilog designs, learning more about:
Combinational circuits
Sequential circuits
Testbenches
FSMs (Finite State Machines)

Tools used : Modelsim
