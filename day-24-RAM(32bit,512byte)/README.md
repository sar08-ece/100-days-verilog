This Verilog module implements a synchronous single-port RAM with the following specifications:

Word Width: 32 bits (4 bytes)

Total Memory: 512 bytes

Depth: 128 words (32-bit)

Address Width: 7 bits

Synchronous Read/Write

Calculation part:
32-bit data width

512 bytes total memory

Since each word is 32 bits = 4 bytes,
→ 512 bytes / 4 = 128 locations
→ Needs 7-bit address (since 2⁷ = 128)
